# rust-adif: ADIF file format parser for Rust

Taken from https://github.com/davepacheco/rust-adif since there are no cargo packages for it

This is a first Rust project, mainly intended to play around with Rust.  The
goal is to implement a basic parser for the [ADIF file
format](http://www.adif.org/308/ADIF_308.htm).
